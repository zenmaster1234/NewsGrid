          <p>True legends loom larger in death than in life. </p>
          <p>When the shocking news came on January 26 that Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter, six family friends and a pilot had died in a helicopter crash near their home in California, sales of his merchandise (and all things Mamba) soared: Retailers sold out of his sneakers within 48 hours, and prices for them on resale platforms like StockX rose to more than $1,000. Bryant’s 2018 autobiography, The Mamba Mentality: How I Play, sold ten times as many copies as it did the previous year, per NPD BookScan. Prices for game-used items and autographed memorabilia more than tripled.</p>
          <p>As the world mourned, Bryant’s business partners were left to grapple with some critical questions surrounding the 18-time All-Star. Chief among them: how to build upon an already lucrative legacy without seeming like vultures.</p>
          <p>“Nike will be respectful and measured in what they do,” says Cowen analyst John Kernan, who believes Bryant is at the heart of a lifestyle brand along the lines of Brand Jordan, which has grown into a $4 billion business for the company. “It is going to play the long game and make sure that everything is done at a premium level with an authentic design and with his brand heritage and DNA embedded in it.”</p>
          <p>Nike collects an estimated revenue of $250 million annually from Mamba shoes and apparel, the main source of the $20 million in annual pretax earnings that will now flow to his estate, which lands at No. 6 on the 2020 Forbes Dead Celebrity ranking. </p>
          <p>“His death is a tragedy and horrific story,” says Ken Goldin, a memorabilia dealer who first worked with Bryant in 1996. “He was brilliant his entire life and then burned out unexpectedly. It makes him a forever legacy, like an Elvis Presley.”</p>
          <p>Managing that legacy over the longer term now falls to Nike, the Lakers and agency giant WME, whose sister agency IMG serves as the caretaker for the estates of Arnold Palmer, No. 4 on the Dead Celebrity list with $25 million, and Norman Rockwell. The Lakers saw the demand last month after winning their record-tying 17th NBA title, which triggered record sales for team merchandise, according to Fanatics, the NBA’s official global e-commerce partner. The top-selling jersey belonged to Finals MVP LeBron James. No. 2 was Bryant’s.</p>
          <p>After retiring in 2016, Bryant continued to loom large over the game. He was a gifted storyteller who devoted much of his time to Granity Studios, the content company he started in 2013. He won an Oscar in 2018 for his animated short film Dear Basketball, based on the retirement poem he wrote for The Players’ Tribune. Last season, more NBA players laced up his signature Nikes than the sneaker giant’s next two most popular lines combined: Kyries and Jordans.</p>

          <p>Seven months after the crash, Nike released new colorways for the Kobe V Protro during “Mamba Week” in August, an annual celebration of Kobe that overlaps with his birthday and a date that represents his two jersey numbers, 8 and 24. It was a limited release, on par with past Mamba Days. Nike usually requires 12 to 16 months when launching new products, and the new colorways were created before Bryant’s death. It plans larger releases this month for the “Bruce Lee” Kobe 5 and in December with a return of his beloved “Grinch” Nikes. A spokesperson said the company will continue “to honor Kobe’s legacy through product offerings over the next several months and through our commitment to community-based programs such as Mamba League and Game Growers.”</p>
          <p>“Nike knows how to be in the moment with these things; they know how to stay authentic yet commercialize moments like this,” says Cowen’s Kerman. “Kobe’s legacy will be one they will carry the torch on.”</p>
